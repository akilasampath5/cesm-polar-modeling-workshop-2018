# 2018 CESM Polar Modeling Workshop Portfolio

This portfolio documents my participation in the **2018 CESM Polar Modeling Workshop**, funded by the **National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of Polar Programs**. The workshop was held at the **National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)** in Boulder, Colorado, from **August 13-17, 2018**. It provided **hands-on training in high-performance computing (HPC), Earth system modeling, and polar science applications** using the **Community Earth System Model (CESM)**.

## 📌 My Experience

As a participant, I engaged in hands-on sessions focused on **configuring, running, and analyzing CESM simulations for polar climate research**. The workshop emphasized:

- ✅ **CESM model setup & execution** for Arctic and Antarctic climate studies.
- ✅ **Atmosphere, Ocean, Sea ice & land ice modeling** to simulate cryospheric interactions.
- ✅ **Using NCAR’s Cheyenne Supercomputer** for large-scale climate simulations.
- ✅ **Post-processing CESM outputs** for climate analysis and visualization.
- ✅ **Interpreting climate model results** in the context of observational data.

Throughout the workshop, I collaborated with **climate scientists, computational modelers, and fellow early-career researchers** to explore CESM’s capabilities in **simulating polar climate variability and change**.
